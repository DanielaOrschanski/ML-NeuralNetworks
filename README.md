# ML-NeuralNetworks
Choose a classification problem that we have seen during the semester (either in the class coding sessions or in the assignments).
Use the same dataset (e.g., beans, EEG, banknotes, birds, seeds, ...), but solve the problem with a neural network.
Esperiment with (i) different number of neurons and layers, (ii) different learning rates, and (iii) different optimizers.
